        "The provided code implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle or 15-puzzle problem, where the goal is to reach a target state from an initial state by sliding tiles in a grid. Here's a brief overview of the process used to solve the puzzle:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reading and Writing States:**\n",
        "   The program first defines functions to read and write states from/to text files. It reads the initial state and target state from separate text files, where each state is represented as a matrix of integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Finding the Blank Tile:**\n",
        "   The position of the blank tile (represented by 0) in the current state is found. The blank tile serves as the empty space that can be used to move other tiles around.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generating Neighboring States:**\n",
        "   The program generates valid neighboring states by swapping the blank tile with adjacent tiles in all possible directions (up, down, left, right). Each new state is created by swapping the blank tile with one of its neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Depth-First Search with Memoization:**\n",
        "   The DFS algorithm is used to explore states starting from the initial state. It uses a depth-first approach, meaning it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The algorithm checks if the current state matches the target state. If they are the same, the puzzle is solved, and the algorithm returns.\n",
        "   - If a depth limit is specified, the algorithm ensures that it doesn't go beyond the specified depth.\n",
        "   - It explores all valid neighboring states that haven't been visited before. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, the algorithm recursively calls itself with the new neighbor state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Output and Display:**\n",
        "   As the algorithm progresses, it prints and writes the intermediate states to an output file. This allows you to track the steps taken to reach the target state. The `print_state` function is responsible for displaying states, and the `write_state` function writes states to the output file.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Main Function:**\n",
        "   The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It takes user input for the paths of the initial and target state files, puzzle size, and depth limit. It then initializes the DFS algorithm with the initial and target states and starts the solving process.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Puzzle Solving Outcome:**\n",
        "   If the algorithm successfully reaches the target state, it prints \"Puzzle solved!\" and displays the sequence of states that lead to the solution. If the puzzle cannot be solved within the specified depth limit, it prints \"Puzzle cannot be solved.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By using Depth-First Search with memoization, the program explores different states and backtracks when necessary, ultimately finding a solution to the puzzle or determining that no solution exists within the specified depth limit. The intermediate states are displayed and recorded, allowing you to see the progression of the algorithm towards the solution."
