The algorithm starts from the initial state and dequeues the current state. If the current state has not been visited before, it adds it to the set of visited states (visited). The algorithm then checks if the target measurement has been achieved in jug A. If so, it returns the sequence of actions that led to that measurement. If not, it generates the next states from the current state and enqueues them for further exploration.\n","\n","Display the result: After the BFS process completes, the intermediate states and actions taken to reach the target measurement are displayed in a tabular format using the tabulate library. The intermediate states represent the amounts of water in both jugs at different stages of the process.\n","\n","Handle unreachable targets: If the target measurement is not reachable using the given jug capacities, the program will output a message indicating that the target measurement is not reachable."],"metadata":{"id":"BMZXxVoeR70U"}}]}
