        "The provided program is a Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game solver using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach for the computer's moves. The objective is to simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe between a human player (you) and the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Components:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Board Representation**: The Tic-Tac-Toe board is represented as a 3x3 matrix, where each cell can be occupied by \"X,\" \"O,\" or left empty (\" \").\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Functions**:\n",
        "    - `print_board`: This function displays the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board on the console and also writes it to an output file if specified.\n",
        "    - `check_win`: This function checks whether a player has won by examining rows, columns, and diagonals of the board.\n",
        "    - `get_available_moves`: This function determines the available (unoccupied) cells on the board where a player can make a move.\n",
        "    - `bfs_move`: This is the BFS algorithm that the computer uses to determine its move. It explores possible game states and makes a winning move if available.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Game Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The game begins with an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board, where the player symbols are \"X\" and \"O.\"\n",
        "2. The main game loop alternates between the human player and the computer.\n",
        "3. For the human player (\"X\"), the program prompts the user to enter the row and column of their move. The program checks if the selected cell is valid and not already occupied.\n",
        "4. For the computer player (\"O\"), the program simulates the thinking process (\"System is thinking...\") and uses the BFS algorithm (`bfs_move`) to determine the best move. This move is then applied to the board.\n",
        "5. After each move, the program checks if the current player has won or if the game is a draw. If either condition is met, the game ends.\n",
        "6. The program outputs the current state of the board after each move, both to the console and an output file named \"output.txt.\"\n",
        "7. If the human player or the computer wins, the program displays a victory message. If the game ends in a draw, the program announces a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interactions and Outputs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The human player is prompted to enter row and column values for their move.\n",
        "- The computer's moves are determined using the BFS algorithm, simulating its thinking process.\n",
        "- The program displays the game's progress and outputs intermediate board states to the console and the \"output.txt\" file.\n"
